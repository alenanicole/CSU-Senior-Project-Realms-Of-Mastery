# Realms of Mastery

Realms of Mastery will be an adventure-style game that is primarily intended for use by 3rd and 4th-grade students and will be based on the South Carolina Academic Standards. The student will get to choose their character and fighting style (math or ELA-based) and will travel the realm while answering a variety of questions to defeat monsters, collect some treasure, and gather achievements. This game will also feature a boss rush mode that will allow students to practice questions geared toward a specific standard that they might be struggling with.
