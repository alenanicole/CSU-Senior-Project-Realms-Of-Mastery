# Realms of Mastery

Realms of Mastery will be an adventure-style game that is primarily intended for use by 3rd and 4th grade students and will be based on the South Carolina Academic Standards. The student will get to choose their character and fighting style (math or ELA-based) and will travel the realm while answering a variety of questions to defeat monsters, collect some treasure, and gather achievements. This game will also feature a boss rush mode that will allow students to practice questions geared toward a specific standard that they might be struggling with.
